and then you can place any css there
Ferdthebird1Today at 3:32 PM
Umm ok
But in the index.html file I added the font attributes in the same way, and it showed correctly

CSS is the proper way to do it
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Ibrahims teaching class html </title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css"> 
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is ibrahims test html page!</h1>
<p>Ibrahim is very smart</p>

 <a href="https://waddlr.netlify.app">This is a link!</a>
  <h2 style="color:powderblue;"> Im also insanely smart </h2>
  <p> Ibrahim is the best </p>

now when you try that code what comes out
also use the w3schools links to make html easier
they have free assets for people learning like u
https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GI48TWPZQI91 check this page to use a sandbox and expermient

it loads my test page
Ferdthebird1Today at 3:38 PM
One more thing- when I make the CSS file, how do I tell it which file's font  to format?
+ ٩ʕ◕౪◕ʔو 𝕴𝖇𝖗𝖆𝖍𝖎𝖒𝕿𝕲𝕯Today at 3:38 PM
Ill explain the fonts now
Which font do you want?
I suggest open sans
Ferdthebird1Today at 3:39 PM
I wanted arial
We can try open sans
+ ٩ʕ◕౪◕ʔو 𝕴𝖇𝖗𝖆𝖍𝖎𝖒𝕿𝕲𝕯Today at 3:40 PM
Open sans is best
ok so its verrry simple
Ferdthebird1Today at 3:40 PM
Ok
But wait, Lemme first make the CSS file
+ ٩ʕ◕౪◕ʔو 𝕴𝖇𝖗𝖆𝖍𝖎𝖒𝕿𝕲𝕯Today at 3:41 PM
Edit the CSS file and type in this code
      body {
        font-family: 'Open Sans', serif;
        font-size: 20px;
      }
But wait, Lemme first make the CSS file
yes do that first
and write the code that i showed above
you can change 20px to anything you want btw
Ferdthebird1Today at 3:43 PM
This is the correct name right?

+ ٩ʕ◕౪◕ʔو 𝕴𝖇𝖗𝖆𝖍𝖎𝖒𝕿𝕲𝕯Today at 3:44 PM

:white_check_mark:
Ferdthebird1Today at 3:46 PM
Ok
And I wrote what you told me
Now?
